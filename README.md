# mirone
MATLAB interface to GDAL created by Joaquim Luis of Universidade do Algarve in Portugal.

Mirone is a MATLAB-based tool that allows the display and manipulation of a large number of image formats through its interface with the GDAL library. Its main purpose is to provide users with a GUI to manipulate GMT grids. In addition, it offers a wide range of tools dedicated to topics in the earth sciences, including tools for multibeam mission planning, elastic deformation studies, tsunami propagation modeling, earth magnetic field computations and magnetic Parker inversions, Euler rotations and poles computations, plate tectonic reconstructions, and seismicity and focal mechanism plotting. The high quality mapping and cartographic capabilities for which GMT is renowned is guaranteed through Mironeâ€™s ability to automatically generate GMT cshell scripts and dos batch files
